                <p> In the lead up to Tết, removing dust and dirt symbolically removes any ill fortune of the past year, while also preparing to welcome kin, living and dead, as well as other visitors, in the first few days of the New Year and to renew relationships with them.  </p>

          <p> At various points during Tết the house is transformed in other ways too. In some homes rooms are temporarily cleared and outside areas readied for the assembly and cooking of festive rice cakes  </p>

          <p> This takes a number of hours, during which time the members of the household and their helpers (your kin and perhaps one or two close friends) relax, play cards for low stakes and catch up with each other's news. In terms of the Tết ideal, this is a time for pleasant sociability and the reinforcement of kinship ties.  </p>

                Transformation of space outside the house also occurs at various times in the calendar when temporary altars are erected on balconies or at front entrances, su for the Têt eve (giao thừa) worship or on the eighth day after Têt, for worship' ( cúng sao ) </p>

              <p> Tết rituals welcoming or sending off the ancestors ( ông bà tổ tiên ) usually require supplementing the already heavily laden ancestral altar with a table on which food and other offerings are placed for worship prior to the fa meal that follows immediately afterwards. </p>
